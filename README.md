# CODEBOOK
Filename - codebook.xlsx
This spreadsheet contains data, coding frameworks, and analysis results from the study *"Why Johnny Signs with Next-Generation Tools."* Below is a summary of each sheet in the workbook:

## Codebook
Contains the finalized coding scheme used in the analysis of our coded interviews. It defines each code and categorizes them under major themes such as Technological, Organizational, Human, and Macroenvironmental factors.

## Evolution of Codebook
Tracks the iterative development and refinement of the codebook specifically for this study. This includes initial codes, revisions, and rationale behind changes.


## Rater A  
## Rater B
Contain the individual coding results from two independent raters. Each row corresponds to a participant or excerpt, with the applied codes listed for comparison.

## Reliability (Rater A - Rater B)
Summarizes inter-rater reliability statistics such as code agreement/disagreement. Useful for validating the consistency of qualitative coding between raters.

## CODE PER SUBJECTS
Aggregates which codes were assigned to each subject (participant) in the tooling study. Helps in understanding the prevalence and distribution of codes.

## Code Saturation
Analyzes the point at which thematic saturation was reached during the tooling interviews. Shows how many new codes emerged over successive interviews.


## Study Theme Definition
Provides detailed definitions and explanations for each theme specific to the tooling study. Acts as a reference for interpreting the codes used.

# Interview Protocol
Our interview protocol is fully given in Appendix B of the paper.
